        <p>Well look who made it this far. I knew you would though because as I have stated time and time again, YOU ARE SPECIAL!</p>
        <p>I want to tell you a secret. Are you listening?.....Wait, before I tell you; you have to promise to keep this between us.</p>
        <h4> We've Been Trying To Reach You About Your Car's Extended Warranty.&#128514;&#128514;&#128514; Just Kidding!!!</h4>
        <p>Alright, my secret is, sometimes I don't think that I can do this. I forget to give myself the grace that I tell others to give themselves. I constantly have to remember to be kind to myself because I do have a lot on my plate. I am a wife and mother of four children, two dogs, and a cat. I am also working a full time job and taking 3 IT classes while managing my household. No matter how far I have come, no matter how much I have accomplished in life, no matter what goals I have reached AND surpassed. I have moments where I want to give up.</p>
        <h4>But I Can't!!!!</h4>
        <p>I have to remember that I am not doing this for my family, and I am not doing this for the money.... well I do want the money, I want to motivate you, not lie &#128514;. </p>
        <p>Anyways, I am doing this for me. I deserve this. I WILL earn this</p>
        <p>No matter what you are doing, trust that you will achieve it. Believe in yourself the same way kids believe their parents are made of money when they walk into stores.</p>
        <h4>Listen, if someone would've told me 10 years ago I would be in college, I would have laughed in their face. Yet here I am. I have a great support system but I also support myself. I believe in me. Below, you will find some motivational quotes that may help you remember how amazing you are. You got this!</h4>
