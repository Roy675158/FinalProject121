        <h2>Self Care Tips</h2>
        <p>Alright! Lets get into the nitty-gritty! What does Self-Care look like for you? As I previously explained, my self-care method includes sitting by the water, and having a drink. One of my favorite things to do also is...you guess it! SLEEP!!!! I didn't mention that earlier because my therapist says I need to excercise more. Not because I'm out of shape. Trust me, she's very body-positive and I love that for her! She tells me to excercise because it can also help me mentally.</p>
        <p>Now, enough about my problems, I mentioned her advice because although my self-care consist of laying around with my dogs, eating snacks, watching tv and ignoring all of my responsibilities; you have to be mindful do it healthy amounts. Meaning its ok to take a break, but it's very easy to fall into depression so decompress and lets get back to it!!!!! YOU GOT THIS!!!!!</p>
        <p>Below you will find some great self-care recommendations!</p>
