        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Self Care Your Way To the Top! My name is Shantell and if you are anything like me, you may be a tad bit stressed. This site is to help you remember that you will not only be ok, but that you can accomplish anything you can dream of. Just don't give up! </p>
        <p>When I am stressed, I love sitting by large bodies of water and having a drink. Please note that I said SITTING by the water, not getting in it. I cannot swim at all &#128514;. But I digress, water calms me. If I can't sit by water for whatever reason, I will turn on some music and have me a glass of wine. This helps me unwind. I can't explain why. The next few pages will provide you with some self-care tips/suggestions, motivation and resources. I hope you enjoy my site!</p>

        <p>So here's a little fun fact about me, I have this ability to always feel like what I am doing isn't good enough. Why? I dont know, my therapist said I'm a bit of a perfectionist &#128514;. That's not my point, my point is that being hard on myself has only brought me more stress. Life is so precious. Which means I don't want to take any second for granted so I have to live by the same advice I give my kids. "It's going to be ok as long as you don't give up."</p>
        <p>With that being said, I invite you to join this movement. What movement you ask? Well the movement entails, Self-Caring your way to the absolute top!! You may also be asking, "Shantell, whats the top?". To that I would like to say, you ask a lot of questions don't you?...YIKES!!!.. Just kidding &#128514;&#128514;</p>
        <p>All jokes aside, the top is wherever and whatever you want to make it. It can be a short term goal or a long time goal. As long as you are striving, you my friend are thriving! Don't give up on yourself. Life gets hard and that's inevitable. If everything came easy then everyone would have it. BUT YOU?? YOU ARE DIFFERENT, YOU ARE AMAZING, AND YOU ARE HERE! No one can do what you've done because you are YOU. That's special, and you are special. See the potential that everyone else see in you. It's going to get hard because growth is hard, elevating is HARD. But once you get past the self-doubt, stress and fear; you'd be amazed at how far you are going to go.</p>    
        <h3>I LOVE YOU!!!!.......So much!!!..</h3>
        <p>Ok, well that may have been a little excessive. &#128514;&#128514;&#128514;. That escalated a little quickly, but I do believe in you though! I know you can do this. You know how I know? Because you are here. If you don't take anything else from this site, I just want you to remember one thing. You didn't come this far to give up. Keep going because it will all be worth it. The tears, the frustation, the ups and the downs? Yes, it will be all be worth it when you are on the other side of this obstacle.</p>
